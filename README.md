# SpringBoot-ToDo-Web-Application

In this lab, you'll develop and enhance a personalized to-do list web application, solidifying essential skills in full-stack development. You'll get to work through real-world tasks like configuring security, handling form data, and creating RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tasks build on prior concepts, allowing you to apply and deepen your understanding of user flows, CRUD operations, and responsive design‚Äîcritical competencies for a junior software developer.

The starter code of this Graded lab provides the code to create a responsive web application to manage the tasks of a user, using the application. But, there are some pieces missing in the code. You will follow the documentation here to complete the TODOs of this project to make the TODO web application fully functional and better. So, without any further delay, let‚Äôs get cracking on the project. 

The project is named TODO Rails since it keeps your TODO tasks on the rails or in line. It will be referred to as T-Rails, in short. 

Goal

To build a personalized to-do list web application where users can manage tasks through a responsive interface. Apply full-stack development skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Spring Boot to create a functional, user-friendly experience.

In your lab environment, open IntelliJ by double-clicking on the icon.


When the IntelliJ IDE opens, you will be brought to the starter code. 

As in previous labs, each TODO clearly identifies your task and the exact position within the program where you should type it. You‚Äôll receive instructions on which file to navigate to for each task. This graded lab organizes all TODOs into flows, with each flow representing a user interaction in the web application. Each flow breaks down into specific tasks, and each task contains one or more TODOs to complete. 

There are a total of 9 flows: 

Public access flow

Login flow

Registration flow

Task flow 1

Dashboard flow 1

Dashboard flow 2

Task flow 2

Password flow

Logout flow 

There is a total of 24 TODOs. 

Important
Use a desktop browser to simulate a mobile. 

Keep JavaScript enabled at all times.

Avoid using the browser‚Äôs back button; instead, navigate only with the application‚Äôs options. If you accidentally hit back and see an ‚Äúexpired‚Äù document message, simply return to http://localhost:8080/dashboard if you‚Äôre logged in.

Pause and check your progress regularly. If you answer each checkpoint question affirmatively, you‚Äôre on the right track. 

Follow each instruction carefully‚Äîfor instance, log in to the T-Rails application as directed when required.

Complete TODOs in order, as some tasks depend on the completion of previous ones.
